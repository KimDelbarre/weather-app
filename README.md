## Objectives
In this challenge you will use and consolidate your knowledge on:

A typical AJAX flow: send asynchronous requests to a remote server and process the results
DOM manipulation: changing the DOM based on the results of the AJAX requests
Learn to aggregate and parse data fetched from an api


## The Mission
You have been sent abroad for a 10-month work mission. Your family and friends back home ask you about the weather where you live ALL. THE. TIME.
Enough is enough, you decide to build a small web application for them so that you can free your time to talk about more interesting topics.

- On clicking the SUBMIT button or pressing ENTER the application will display the weather for the next 5 days
- The application must be responsive and mobile friendly

**Nice-to-have features (in no specific order)**
- Display a line graph of temperature over time using a library such as https://www.chartjs.org/
- Remember the user choice on subsequent visits
- Allow the user to compare the weather in two cities
- Use the API of https://unsplash.com/ to show a photo of the city they entered in the form.
